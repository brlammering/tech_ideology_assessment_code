# B2_transform_to_parquet_contributions.R
# Convert raw contribDB CSV.gz files to a Hive-partitioned parquet dataset.
#
# Layout written:  data/raw/raw_contributions_parquet/cycle=1980/contribDB_1980.parquet
#
# Design notes:
#   - prepare_source() decompresses, normalises encoding only when needed, and
#     strips end-of-line backslashes. Those backslashes are the real defect in
#     DIME's export: they leave a quoted memo field unterminated, so DuckDB
#     consumes to EOF looking for the closing quote and OOMs. Legitimate
#     multi-line quoted fields are left intact for DuckDB to parse normally.
#   - No LIMIT/OFFSET chunking. read_csv -> COPY is streaming; OFFSET over a
#     CSV re-reads and discards rows, making the old loop quadratic. Worse, it
#     masked the quote bug by treating a short batch as end-of-file.
#   - No PARTITION_BY. DuckDB buffers per-partition writers in memory. Each
#     source file is one cycle, so we write the cycle=NNNN/ directory ourselves.
#   - Cycle comes from the filename, not from a scan. Verified after writing.
#   - Completed cycles are skipped on re-run; see parquet_is_complete().

#   3. schema matches expected_cols (guards against files from an older
#      version of this script with a different column set)
#   4. non-empty, and every row carries the expected cycle
# Returns the row count if complete, NULL if the file should be rebuilt.
