# USER-FACING API
# =============================================================================

#' Get the EDGAR reference table
#'
#' Returns a tibble with columns cik, real_name, sic, sic_description. On
#' first call this downloads SEC's bulk archive (~1.3 GB) and builds the
#' table locally, which is slow but only needs to happen once. Later calls
#' just read the cached parquet. If the cached table is missing but a
#' backup exists (see edgar_backup()), restore from that instead of
#' rebuilding.
#'
#' @param root parent directory for zip, parts, backups, spill. Change
#'   only if the default `data/edgar/` collides with something.
#' @param n_workers concurrent chunks. Default 2 is safe on 16 GB shared
#'   with an IDE and browser. Raise cautiously: N workers = N x memory
#'   footprint at once, not just N x speed. Watch `free -h` during a run.
#' @param n_chunks how many equal-sized pieces to split the archive into.
#'   Default 100 gives ~150-250 MB per chunk. On tighter machines raise
#'   this (smaller pieces); on a dedicated box drop it for fewer, faster
#'   pieces. See design notes at the bottom of this file for why chunking
#'   is by POSITION in the file list, not by CIK value.
#' @param duckdb_memory_limit DuckDB's own cap. Governs its internal
#'   bookkeeping, not OS-level RSS -- leave meaningful headroom below your
#'   free memory. Default "1GB".
#' @param duckdb_threads how many threads DuckDB uses inside a chunk.
#'   Default 2. read_json parallelizes across threads and each thread
#'   holds working memory -- on many-core machines the total can crowd
#'   out the query itself and trigger DuckDB's memory_limit even when
#'   the machine has RAM to spare. If you get a "failed to allocate"
#'   error inside a chunk, lower this before raising memory_limit.
#' @param force_rebuild rebuild even if a valid cached table exists.
#'
#' @return tibble with one row per EDGAR filer that has a non-null name

# DESIGN NOTES (why the pipeline looks the way it does)
# =============================================================================
#
# Original problem: an earlier per-CIK API version made ~1M HTTPS calls to
# data.sec.gov, took hours, and crashed on rate-limit/timeout losing
# everything. Everything below responds to that or to failure modes
# encountered while iterating on the replacement.
#
# BULK DOWNLOAD. SEC publishes the same JSON as one ~1.3 GB zip. Fetch
# once, parse locally: no rate limits, no thousand-request accumulation
# of failure surface.
#
# NO SYSTEM `unzip`. R's own unzip() with a `files=` allowlist of ~1M
# entries is O(n²) in practice (never finished after 8 hours, silently).
# System `unzip` avoids that but requires the binary on PATH -- not a
# portable assumption. The `archive` package (libarchive) handles this
# on every OS the same way. IMPORTANT: pass exact filenames to
# archive_extract(files=), NOT integer indices. Indices were silently
# ignored in one observed run: it extracted the whole archive before
# running out of disk.
#
# CHUNK BY POSITION. Real CIKs are sequential integers only reaching low
# millions; zero-padded to 10 digits, virtually every one starts with
# several leading zeros. Sharding by CIK-value prefix (which an earlier
# version did) creates ~1 giant bucket and ~99 empty ones. Cutting the
# file list into equal-count pieces by position sidesteps that entirely.
#
# SUBPROCESS PER CHUNK. R's memory allocator (glibc malloc) doesn't
# reliably return freed memory to the OS within one long-running
# process. DuckDB, running embedded in the same process, hits the same
# issue. Two OOMs happened even with gc(full = TRUE) + dbDisconnect(
# shutdown = TRUE) between chunks. Running each chunk in a fresh
# callr::r_bg() subprocess means the OS reclaims everything
# unconditionally when it exits. This is the only guarantee strong
# enough given the observed failures.
#
# PARALLELISM. n_workers subprocesses run concurrently. Concurrent
# workers CANNOT share a scratch or spill directory -- one's cleanup
# would delete another's in-flight work. Each gets its own
# subdirectory keyed by chunk id.
#
# SPILL TO REAL DISK. DuckDB's temp_directory defaults to somewhere near
# scratch_dir, which on Linux is /dev/shm (RAM). If a query needs to
# spill, doing so into RAM doesn't relieve memory pressure. Explicitly
# point spill at data/edgar/duckdb_spill/.
#
# DUCKDB THREADS + INSERTION ORDER. Even inside a subprocess, DuckDB
# itself can refuse an allocation with "failed to allocate ... (X MiB /
# 1 GiB used)" if a query's parallelism exceeds what fits under
# memory_limit. read_json parallelizes across threads and each thread
# holds working memory; on many-core machines the sum crowds out the
# query itself. Observed once on chunk 0002 with default threading.
# Cap threads and disable insertion-order preservation (both are the
# fixes DuckDB itself suggests in the error, and read_json + COPY don't
# need a stable row order).
#
# UNCONDITIONAL SCRATCH CLEANUP. Register on.exit(unlink(scratch_dir))
# BEFORE anything that can fail. Registering it only on the success
# path (the last line of the function) left 3.5 GB of orphaned
# extraction data pinned in /dev/shm after crashes -- observed twice.
#
# STALE-SCRATCH SWEEP. The build clears scratch_dir at startup, so
# leftovers from a previous crash don't compound with the current run's
# footprint. Only safe because scratch_dir has a deterministic name;
# a PID-based name would leave leftovers indistinguishable from junk.
#
# ATOMIC PART FILES. Each chunk writes part_XXX.parquet.tmp, then
# renames on success. A restart never sees a half-written part file
# treated as completed work.
#
# MANIFEST + BACKUP. profile_parts/MANIFEST.rds records what zip was
# used; a mismatch on later runs triggers a stale-cache warning
# instead of silent staleness. backups/ holds timestamped snapshots
# so recovery from an accidental force_rebuild or `rm -rf` costs a
# copy rather than a full multi-hour rebuild.
#
# FUZZY MATCHER: BUILD ONCE. Deduplicating ~800k reference names
# is the expensive step. edgar_matcher()
# does it once; edgar_match() reuses the returned object across as
# many batches as you want.
#
# THREE-TIER MATCH. Exact match handles the near-free majority.
# JW handles typos and light transpositions on what's left. Ordering by cost also
# means the expensive amatch() only runs on the small residual set.
